	<h1> AIR HOCKEY</h1>
	
	<p><h2> In this software, Ryan and I developed a a virtual version of air hockey.
	This air hockey game comes with a bonus map version which provides a Soccer Version aswell! 
	This game can be played either single player or multiplayer. 
	In single player, the player uses the mouse to hit the Hockeypuck/Soccerball andfaces against a CPU in either Hockey or Soccer.
	In the other hand, if the player decides to play multiplayer there will be two sets of controls. Player 1 control's 
	is the mouse itself; player 2 control's is the up, down, left, right controls.<p></h2>
